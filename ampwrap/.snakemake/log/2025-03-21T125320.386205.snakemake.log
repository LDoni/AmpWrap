Removing output files of failed job combine_cutadapt_logs since they might be corrupted:
/media/shared1/alessiam/dadawrap/datiseq_out/intermediate/cutadapt/cutadapt_primer_trimming_stats.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
