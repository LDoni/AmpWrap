MissingOutputException in rule emu_abundance in file /media/shared1/alessiam/dadawrap/ampwrap/ampwrap/snakefile.long, line 214:
Job 8  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/media/shared1/alessiam/dadawrap/bench_nano_999/results/emu/SRR20752542_rdp_rel-abundance.tsv
/media/shared1/alessiam/dadawrap/bench_nano_999/results/emu/SRR20752542_rdp_read-assignment-distributions.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
