MissingOutputException in rule multiqc_post in file /media/shared1/alessiam/dadawrap/ampwrap/ampwrap/snakefile.long, line 195:
Job 14  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/media/shared1/alessiam/dadawrap/subseq_nanopore_results_5/QC/raw_qc_post/multiqc_report.html
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
